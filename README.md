# HorseRace

## Motivation

Horserace is a for-fun-project inspired by a computing class exercise of school made in Basic.

This does not pretend to be something great, just practice what I have learnt and I am learning about programming, always in a fun way.

### The original HorseRace

I do not remember what was the requirements, but I remember multiple lines growing until one touching the finish line. I will start doing that.
